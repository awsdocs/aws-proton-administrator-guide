# Update a service pipeline<a name="ag-svc-pipeline-update"></a>

Learn to update a service pipeline and cancel the update\.

A service pipeline belongs to a service\. You can only create or delete a pipeline within the context of service [create](ag-create-svc.md) and [delete](ag-svc-delete.md) actions\.

There are four modes for updating a service pipeline as described in the following list\. When using the AWS CLI, the `deployment-type` field defines the mode\. When you use the console, these modes map to the **Edit pipeline** and **Update to recommended version**\.

  
`NONE`  
In this mode, a deployment *doesn't* occur\. Only the requested metadata parameters are updated\.

  
`CURRENT_VERSION`  
In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the new spec that you provide\. Only requested parameters are updated\. *Don’t* include minor or major version parameters when you use this `deployment-type`\.

  
`MINOR_VERSION`  
In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended \(latest\) minor version of the current major version in use by default\. You can also specify a different minor version of the current major version in use\.

  
`MAJOR_VERSION`  
In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the published, recommended \(latest\) major and minor version of the current template by default\. You can also specify a different major version that is higher than the major version in use and a minor version \(optional\)\.

You can attempt to cancel a service pipeline update deployment if the `deploymentStatus` is `IN_PROGRESS`\. AWS Proton attempts to cancel the deployment\. Successful cancellation isn’t guaranteed\.

When you cancel an update deployment, AWS Proton attempts to cancel the deployment as listed in the following steps\.
+ Sets the deployment state to `CANCELLING`\.
+ Stops the deployment in process and deletes any new resources that were created by the deployment when `IN_PROGRESS`\.
+ Sets the deployment state to `CANCELLED`\.
+ Reverts the state of the resource to what it was before the deployment was started\.

For more information on cancelling a service pipeline deployment, see [CancelServicePipelineDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_CancelServicePipelineDeployment.html) in the *AWS Proton API Reference*\.

**Use the console or AWS CLI to make updates or cancel update deployments\.**

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**Update a service pipeline using the console as described in the following steps\.**

1. In the [AWS Proton console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/proton/), choose **Services**\.

1. In the list of services, choose the name of the service that you want to update the pipeline for\.

1. There are two tabs on the service detail page, **Overview** and **Pipeline**\. Choose **Pipeline**\.

1. If you want to update specs, choose **Edit Pipeline** and fill out each form and choose **Next** until you complete the final form and then choose **Update pipeline**\.

   If you want to update to a new version and there's an **information icon** that indicates a new version is available at **Pipeline template**, choose the name of the new template version\.

   1. Choose **Update to recommended version**\.

   1. Fill out each form and choose **Next** until you complete the final form and choose **Update**\.

#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Update a service pipeline to a new minor version as shown in the following CLI example commands and responses\.**

When you update your service pipeline with a modified `spec`, you can use `"${Proton::CURRENT_VAL}"` to indicate which parameter values to preserve from the original `spec`, if the values exist in the `spec`\. Use `get-service` to view the original `spec` for a service pipeline, as described in [View service data](ag-svc-view.md)\.

The following example shows how you can use `"${Proton::CURRENT_VAL}"` in a `spec`\.

Spec:

```
proton: ServiceSpec

pipeline:
  my_sample_pipeline_optional_input: "${Proton::CURRENT_VAL}"
  my_sample_pipeline_required_input: "${Proton::CURRENT_VAL}"

instances:
  - name: "my-instance"
    environment: "simple-env"
    spec:
      my_sample_service_instance_optional_input: "${Proton::CURRENT_VAL}"
      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "${Proton::CURRENT_VAL}"
  - name: "my-other-instance"
    environment: "simple-env"
    spec:
      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "789"
```

Command: to update

```
aws proton update-service-pipeline \
    --service-name "simple-svc" \
    --spec "file://service-spec.yaml" \
    --template-major-version "1" \
    --template-minor-version "1" \
    --deployment-type "MINOR_VERSION"
```
