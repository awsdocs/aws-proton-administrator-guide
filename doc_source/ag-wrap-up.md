After preparing your environment and service infrastructure as code \(IaC\) files and their respective schema files, you must organize them in directories\. You must also create a manifest YAML file\.

The manifest file lists the IaC files in a directory and needs to adhere to the format and content shown in the following example\.

**CloudFormation manifest file format:**

With CloudFormation, you list a single file\.

```
infrastructure:
  templates:
    - file: "cloudformation.yaml"
      rendering_engine: jinja
      template_language: cloudformation
```

**Terraform manifest file format:**

With terraform, you can explicitly list a single file or use the wildcard, `*.tf`, to list each of the files in a directory\.

```
infrastructure:
  templates:
    - file: "*.tf"
      rendering_engine: hcl
      template_language: terraform
```

 After you set up the directories and manifest files for your environment or service template bundle, you gzip the directories into a tar ball upload them to an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket where AWS Proton can retrieve them\.

When you create a minor version of an environment or a service template that you registered with AWS Proton, you provide the path to your environment or service template bundle tar ball that's located in your S3 bucket\. AWS Proton saves it with the new template minor version\. You can select the new template minor version to create or update environments or services with AWS Proton\.

There are two types of environment template bundles that you create for AWS Proton\.
+ To create an environment template bundle for a *standard* environment template, organize the schema, infrastructure as code \(IaC\) files and manifest file in directories as shown in the following environment template bundle directory structure\.
+ To create an environment template bundle for a *customer managed* environment template, provide only the schema file and directory\. *Don't* include the infrastructure directory and files\. AWS Proton throws an error if the infrastructure directory and files are included\.

For more information, see [Register and publish templates](template-create.md)\.

CloudFormation environment template bundle directory structure:

```
 /schema
   schema.yaml
 /infrastructure
   manifest.yaml
   cloudformation.yaml
```

Terraform environment template bundle directory structure:

```
 /schema
   schema.yaml
 /infrastructure
   manifest.yaml
   environment.tf
```

## Service template bundle wrap up<a name="service-wrap-up"></a>

**Important**  
**Provisioning by pull request** is currently in **feature preview** and is only usable with Terraform based AWS Proton Templates\. To learn more about [AWS Feature Preview terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms), see section 2 on Beta and Previews\.

To create a service template bundle, you must organize the schema, infrastructure as code \(IaC\) files, and manifest files into directories as shown in the service template bundle directory structure example\.

If you *donâ€™t* include a service pipeline in your template bundle, *don't* include the pipeline directory and files and set `"pipelineProvisioning": "CUSTOMER_MANAGED"` when you create the service template that is to be associated with this template bundle\.

**Note**  
You can't modify `pipelineProvisioning` after the service template is created\.

CloudFormation service template bundle directory structure:

```
 /schema
   schema.yaml
 /instance_infrastructure

```

Terraform service template bundle directory structure:
