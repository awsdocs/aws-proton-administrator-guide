# EventBridgeTutorial: Send Amazon Simple Notification Service alerts for AWS Proton service status changes<a name="event-tutorial-sns"></a>

In this tutorial, you use an AWS Proton pre\-configured *event rule* that captures status changes for your AWS Proton service\. EventBridge sends the status changes to an Amazon SNS topic\. You subscribe to the topic and Amazon SNS sends you status change emails for your AWS Proton service\.

## Prerequisites<a name="event-tutorial-sns-prereq"></a>

You have an existing AWS Proton service with an `Active` status\. As part of this tutorial, you can add service instances to this service, and then delete the instances\.

If you need to create an AWS Proton service, see [Getting started with AWS Proton](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-getting-started.html)\. For more information, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-limits.html) and [Edit a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/ag-svc-update.html)\.

## Step 1: Create and subscribe to an Amazon SNS topic<a name="event-tutorial-sns-step1"></a>

Create an Amazon SNS topic to serve as an *event target* for the *event rule* that you create in Step 2\.

**Create an Amazon SNS topic**

1. Log in and open the [Amazon SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Topics**, **Create topic**\.

## Step 2: Register an event rule<a name="event-tutorial-ebridge-step2"></a>

Register an *event rule* that captures status changes for your AWS Proton service\. For more information, see [Prerequisites](#event-tutorial-sns-prereq)\.

**Create an event rule\.**

      1. In **Services** page, choose the name of your AWS Proton service\.

      1. In **Service details** page, copy the service Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\.

      1. Navigate back to the *EventBridge console* and your tutorial rule and choose **Edit** at the text editor\.

      1. In the text editor, for `"resources":`, enter the service ARN that you copied in step viii\.

         ```
         {
             "source": ["aws.proton"],
             "detail-type": ["AWS Proton Service Status Change"],
             "resources": ["arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/your-service"]
         }
         ```

      1. **Save** the event pattern\.
