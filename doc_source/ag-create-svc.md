# Create a service<a name="ag-create-svc"></a>

**When you create an AWS Proton service, you can choose from two different types of service templates:**
+ A service template that includes a service pipeline \(default\)\.
+ A service template that *doesn't* include a service pipeline\.

You must create at least one service instance when you create your service\.

A service instance and optional pipeline belong to a service\. You can only create or delete an instance or pipeline within the context of service *create* and *delete* actions\. To learn how to add and remove instances from a service, see [Edit a service](ag-svc-update.md)\.

**Note**  
Your environment is configured for either AWS\- or self\-managed provisioning\. AWS Proton provisions services in an environment using the same provisioning method as the environment uses\. The developer creating or updating service instances doesn't see the difference and their experience is the same in both case\.  
For more information about provisioning methods, see [How AWS Proton provisions infrastructure](ag-works-prov-methods.md)\.

The following procedures show how to use the AWS Proton console or AWS CLI to create a service with or without a service pipeline\.

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**Create a service as shown in the following console steps\.**

1. In the [AWS Proton console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/proton/), choose **Services**\.

1. Choose **Create service**\.

1. In the **Choose a service template** page, select a template and choose **Configure**\.

   When you *don't* want to use an enabled pipeline, choose a template marked with *Excludes pipeline* for your service\.

1. In the **Configure service** page, in the **Service settings** section, enter an **Service name**\.

1. \(Optional\) Enter a description for the service\.

1. 

**In the **Service repository settings** section:**

   1. For **CodeStar Connection**, choose your connection from the list\.

   1. For **Repository ID**, choose the name of your source code repository from the list\.

   1. For **Branch name**, choose the name of your source code repository branch from the list\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Tags** section, choose **Add new tag** and enter a key and value to create a customer managed tag\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Configure custom settings** page, in the **Service instances** section, in the **New instance** section\. You must enter values for the `required` parameters\. You can enter values for the `optional` parameters or use the defaults when given\.

1. In the **Pipeline inputs** section, you must enter values for the `required` parameters\. You can enter values for the `optional` parameters or use the defaults when given\.

1. Choose **Next** and review your inputs\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

   View the service details and status, as well as the AWS managed tags and customer managed tags for your service\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Services**\.

   A new page displays a list of your services along with the status and other service details\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

When you use the AWS CLI, you specify service inputs in a YAML formatted `spec` file, `.aws-proton/service.yaml`, located in your source code directory\.

You can use the CLI `get-service-template-minor-version` command to view the schema required and optional parameters that you provide values for in your spec file\.

If you want to use a service template that has `pipelineProvisioning: "CUSTOMER_MANAGED"`, *don’t* include the `pipeline:` section in your spec and *don’t* include `-repository-connection-arn`, `-repository-id`, and `-branch-name` parameters in your `create-service` command\.

**Create a service with a service pipeline as shown in the following CLI steps\.**

1. **Set up the [service role](security_iam_service-role-policy-examples.md#codepipeline-proton-svc-role) for the pipeline as shown in the following CLI example command\.**

   Command:

   ```
   $ aws proton update-account-settings \
           -pipeline-service-role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSProtonServiceRole"
   ```

1. The following listing shows an example spec, based on the service template schema, that includes the service pipeline and instance inputs\.

   Spec:

   ```
   proton: ServiceSpec
   
   pipeline:
     my_sample_pipeline_required_input: "hello"
     my_sample_pipeline_optional_input: "bye"
   
   instances:
     - name: "acme-network-dev"
       environment: "ENV_NAME"
       spec:
         my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "hi"
         my_sample_service_instance_optional_input: "ho"
   ```

   **Create a service with a pipeline as shown in the following CLI example command and response\.**

   Command:

   ```
   $ aws proton create-service \
           -name "MySimpleService" \
           -branch-name "mainline" \
           -template-major-version "1" \
           -template-name "fargate-service" \
           -repository-connection-arn "arn:aws:codestar-connections:region-id:123456789012:connection/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
           -repository-id "myorg/myapp" \
           -spec "file://spec.yaml"
   ```

   Response:

   ```
   {
       "service": {
           "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/MySimpleService",
           "createdAt": "2020-11-18T19:50:27.460000+00:00",
           "lastModifiedAt": "2020-11-18T19:50:27.460000+00:00",
           "name": "MySimpleService",
           "repositoryConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:region-id:123456789012:connection/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
           "repositoryId": "myorg/myapp",
           "status": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
           "templateName": "fargate-service"
       }
   }
   ```

**Create a service without a service pipeline as shown in the following CLI example command and response\.**

The following shows an example spec that *doesn't* include service pipeline inputs\.

Spec:

```
proton: ServiceSpec

instances:
  - name: "acme-network-dev"
    environment: "ENV_NAME"
    spec:
      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "hi"
      my_sample_service_instance_optional_input: "ho"
```

**To create a service *without* a provisioned service pipeline, you provide the path to a `spec.yaml` and you *don't* include repository parameters as shown in the following CLI example command and response\.**

Command:

```
$ aws proton create-service \
        -name "MySimpleServiceNoPipeline" \
        -template-major-version "1" \
        -template-name "fargate-service" \
        -spec "file://spec-no-pipeline.yaml"
```

Response:

```
{
    "service": {
        "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/MySimpleServiceNoPipeline",
        "createdAt": "2020-11-18T19:50:27.460000+00:00",
        "lastModifiedAt": "2020-11-18T19:50:27.460000+00:00",
        "name": "MySimpleServiceNoPipeline",
        "status": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
        "templateName": "fargate-service-no-pipeline"
    }
}
```
