# Create an environment<a name="ag-create-env"></a>

Learn to create AWS Proton environments\.

**You can create two types of environments:**
+ Create, manage, and provision a standard environment by using a *standard environment template*\. AWS Proton provisions infrastructure for your environment\.
+ Connect AWS Proton to customer\-managed infrastructure by using a *customer\-managed environment template*\. You provision your own shared resources outside of AWS Proton, and then you provide provisioning outputs that AWS Proton can use\.

**You can choose one of several provisioning approaches when you create an environment\.**
+ *AWS\-managed provisioning* – Create, manage, and provision an environment in a single account\. AWS Proton provisions your environment\.

  This method only supports CloudFormation infrastructure as code \(IaC\) templates\.
+ *AWS\-managed provisioning to another account* – In a single management account, create and manage an environment that is provisioned in another account with environment account connections\. AWS Proton provisions your environment in the other account\. For more information, see [Create an environment in one account and provision in another account](#ag-create-env-deploy-other) and [Environment account connections](ag-env-account-connections.md)\.

  This method only supports CloudFormation IaC templates\.
+ *Self\-managed provisioning* – AWS Proton submits provisioning pull requests to a registered repository with your own provisioning infrastructure\.

  This method only supports Terraform IaC templates\.

With AWS\-managed provisioning \(both in the same account and to another account\), AWS Proton makes direct calls to provision your resources\.

With self\-managed provisioning, AWS Proton makes pull requests to provide compiled IaC files that your IaC engine uses to provision resources\.

For more information, see [How AWS Proton provisions infrastructure](ag-works-prov-methods.md), [Template bundles](ag-template-bundles.md), and [Schema requirements for environment template bundles](ag-schema.md#schema-req-env)\.

   View the environment details and status, as well as the AWS managed tags and customer managed tags for your environment\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Environments**\.

   A new page displays a list of your environments along with the status and other environment details\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Use the AWS CLI to create and provision an environment in a single account\.**

To create an environment, you specify the [AWS Proton service role](security_iam_service-role-policy-examples.md#proton-svc-role) ARN, path to your spec file, environment name, environment template ARN, the major and minor versions, and description \(optional\)\.

The next examples shows a YAML formatted spec file that specifies values for two inputs, defined in the environment template schema file\. You can use the `get-environment-template-minor-version` command to view the environment template schema\.

Spec:

```
proton: EnvironmentSpec
spec:
  my_sample_input: "the first"
  my_other_sample_input: "the second"
```

Create an environment\.

Run the following command:

```
$ aws proton create-environment \
    --name "MySimpleEnv" \
    --template-name simple-env \
    --template-major-version 1 \
    --proton-service-role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSProtonServiceRole" \
    --spec "file://env-spec.yaml"
```

Response:

```
{
    "environment": {
        "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:environment/MySimpleEnv",
        "createdAt": "2020-11-11T23:03:05.405000+00:00",
        "deploymentStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
        "lastDeploymentAttemptedAt": "2020-11-11T23:03:05.405000+00:00",
        "name": "MySimpleEnv",
        "protonServiceRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ProtonServiceRole",
        "templateName": "simple-env"
    }
}
```

After you create a new environment, you can view a list of AWS and customer managed tags, as shown in the following example command\. AWS Proton automatically generates AWS managed tags for you\. You can also modify and create customer managed tags using the AWS CLI\. For more information, see [AWS Proton resources and tagging](resources.md)\.

Command:

```
$ aws proton list-tags-for-resource \
    --resource-arn "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:environment/MySimpleEnv"
```

## Create and provision an environment using self\-managed provisioning<a name="ag-create-env-pull-request"></a>

When you use self\-managed provisioning, AWS Proton submits provisioning pull requests to a registered repository with your own provisioning infrastructure\. The pull requests trigger your own workflow, which calls AWS services to provision infrastructure\.

**Self\-managed provisioning prerequisites:**
+ You have [registered a repository with AWS Proton](ag-create-repo.md)\.
+ You have set up a repository resource directory for self\-managed provisioning\. For more information, see [Infrastructure as code files](ag-infrastructure-tmp-files.md)\.
+ You have an [AWS CodeStar connection](setting-up-for-service.md) for your repository\.

**Considerations:**
+ After you create the environment, AWS Proton waits to receive asynchronous notifications regarding the status of your infrastructure provisioning\. Your provisioning code must use the AWS Proton `NotifyResourceStateChange` API to send these asynchronous notifications to AWS Proton\.

You can use self\-managed provisioning in the console or with the AWS CLI\. The following examples show how you can use self\-managed provisioning with Terraform\.

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**Use the console to create a Terraform environment using self\-managed provisioning\.**

1. In the [AWS Proton console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/proton/), choose **Environments**\.

1. Choose **Create environment**\.

1. In the **Choose an environment template** page, select a Terraform template and choose **Configure**\.

1. In the **Configure environment** page, in the **Provisioning** section, choose **Self\-managed provisioning**\.

1. In the **Repository details** section:

   1. Select a repository provider\.

   1. For **CodeStar connection** section, choose from your connections\.

   1. For **Repository name**, choose from your repository names\.

   1. For **Branch name**, choose from your branches\.

1. In the **Environment settings** section, enter an **Environment name**\.

1. \(Optional\) Enter a description for the environment\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Tags** section, choose **Add new tag** and enter a key and value to create a customer managed tag\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Configure environment custom settings** page, you must enter values for the `required` parameters\. You can enter values for the `optional` parameters or use the defaults when given\.

1. Choose **Next** and review your inputs\.

1. Choose **Create** to send a pull request\.
   + If you approve the pull request, the deployment is in progress\.
   + If you reject the pull request, the environment creation is cancelled\.
   + If the pull request times out, environment creation *isn't* complete\.

1. View the environment details and status, as well as the AWS managed tags and customer managed tags for your environment\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Environments**\.

   A new page displays a list of your environments along with the status and other environment details\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

When you create an environment using self\-managed provisioning, you *add* the `provisioningRepository` parameter and omit the `ProtonServiceRoleArn` and `environmentAccountConnectionId` parameters\.

**Use the AWS CLI to create a Terraform environment with self\-managed provisioning\.**

1. Create an environment and send a pull request to the repository for review and approval\.

   The next examples shows a YAML formatted spec file that defines values for two inputs, based on the environment template schema file\. You can use the `get-environment-template-minor-version` command to view the environment template schema\.

   Spec:

   ```
   proton: EnvironmentSpec
   spec:
     ssm_parameter_value: "test"
   ```

   Create an environment:

   Command:

   ```
   $ aws proton create-environment \
       --name "pr-environment" \
       --template-name "pr-env-template" \
       --template-major-version "1" \
       --provisioning-repository="branch=main,name=myrepos/env-repo,provider=GITHUB" \
       --spec "file://env-spec.yaml"
   ```

   Response:

   ```
   {
       "environment": {
           "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:environment/pr-environment",
           "createdAt": "2021-11-18T17:06:58.679000+00:00",
           "deploymentStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
           "lastDeploymentAttemptedAt": "2021-11-18T17:06:58.679000+00:00",
           "name": "pr-environment",
           "provisioningRepository": {
               "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:repository/github:myrepos/env-repo",
               "branch": "main",
               "name": "myrepos/env-repo",
               "provider": "GITHUB"
           },
           "templateName": "pr-env-template"
       }
   ```

1. Review the request\.
   + If you approve the request, provisioning is in progress\.
   + If you reject the request, the environment creation is cancelled\.
   + If the pull request times out, environment creation *isn't* complete\.

1. Asynchronously provide provisioning status to AWS Proton\. The following example notifies AWS Proton of a successful provisioning\.

   ```
   $ aws proton notify-resource-deployment-status-change \
       --resource-arn "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:environment/pr-environment" \
       --status "SUCCEEDED"
   ```
